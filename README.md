## Features
### Anti Enderman Grief
Removes functionality of endermen being able to pick up blocks
### Baby Mobs
Adds a customizable case-sensitive name tag that stops mobs from being able to grow, or turning them into their baby variant if they are already adults. (Only works on breedable animals)
### Cauldron Concrete Conversion
Gives the option to allow players to convert concrete powder into it's regular concrete variant by dropping the item into a cauldron full of water.
### No Anvil Limit
Removes the "Too Expensive!" limit in anvils. Functionality may be removed if bukkit's deprecation turns into full non-support and loss of functionality.

The scaling continues as Minecraft regularly would, and since the "Too Expensive!" prompt is hard-coded client-side for anvil uses that cost more than 39 experience levels, it will still show for the player, but the anvil will still have a usable output.
### Silent Mobs
Adds a customizable case-sensitive name tag that will silence a mob with the given name.
### Silk Touch+
Adds the ability to let silk touch work on reinforced deepslate and budding amethyst.
### Configs & Commands
Modify configs and reload the plugin via in-game commands.
